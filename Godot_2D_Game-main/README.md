# Godot_2D_Game
Simple game to get allong better with Godot

The Game is going to be about two players that are shooting Projectiles at eachother in a Angry Birds like style.
Between the shooting phases I want to implement building phases where the players can spawn physiks objects in to the world, to build defence or to destroy the enemys defence.
